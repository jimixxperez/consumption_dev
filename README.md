## consumption deviation from forecasted temperature

positive value = deficit = more consumption than expected
negative value = surplus = less consumption than expected

The assumption is that the average value on one day is positive (deficit) or negative (surplus) depending on the temperature deviation in Germany on that day.
Why? Energy supplier are doing their daily consumption forecast based on the historical temperature for the same day.  Example: If they do a forecast for the consumption for the 01.01.13, they will look on the temperature of the 01.01 of 2012, 01.01 of 2011, 01.01 of 2010… etc.
That is why we expect for example a deficit in a cold winter (because of more heating) and a surplus in a warm winter.
We expect the reverse relationship in summer.
Can we say with a certain probability that we will have a surplus or a deficit depending on the temperature deviation?
For this, please compare the daily temperature for 2013 with the average temperature of these days in the past (you can choose the amount of years you take to calculate the average)
